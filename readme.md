# Project - SKKU Corona Map

## A Brief Overview

-   To keep track of a user's workout routine, and to provide information about the number of users at the gym.

## Example

-   Image input required

## 1. Releases

-   v.1.0.0 - Needs to be released someday...

## 2. History

1. Implement an overall HTML Format of all pages

2. Implement calendar for each month

```js
var each_trial = {          // Information of each trial. All workouts cannot be done uniformly
    workout_Name: "",       // Name of the workout. e.g. Pushup, Bench Press...
    workout_Quantity: 0,    // Number of conducts for this set.
    set_Num: 0,             // nth set for this workout
};

var each_workout = {        // Contains the whole information of each trial for that workout that was conducted for that day
    // each_trial structures
    prog_Overload: false    // Contains information of whether that workout was successfully conducted for that day.
    workout_Part: ""        // Which part of the body is that workout for e.g. Biceps, Triceps ...
}

var each_day = {            // Contains information of all the workouts that was done for that day
    // Each workout structures
    // Date of that day e.g. 11/07/2021
}
```

3. Look for a way to save the number of visitors to the gym in a server


## 3. Future

-   I don't know..

## 4. Code of Conduct

-   main branch는 가능하면 건들지 않는다.
-   미완성 기능의 경우 새로운 branch를 만들고 작업한다.
-   작업이 완료되면 Merge한다.
-   이건 저희도 같이 하죠.
